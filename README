# 修改ssh客户端的端口

## 你懂得

可能因为某些原因,你必须指定客户端端口,但是`ssh`的`-b`选项只能指定绑定的地址,不能绑定端口,所以这里我们需要更改源代码

## 修改

1. 下载 [openssh](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable)我这次试用了版本 `openssh-portable-V_8_3_P1`

2. 找到`ssh.c`的`main`函数,可以找到`-b`选项,搜索`case '-b'`

3. 由此我们找到结构体`options`的定义,增加端口的定义`int  options.bind_port`

4. 修改`ssh.c@main`

    ```c
    char myaddress[100]={};
    .....
        case 'b':
            sscanf(optarg,"%[^:]:%d",myaddress,&options.bind_port);			
            options.bind_address = myaddress;
            break;
    ```

5. 修改`sshconnect.c @430`  

    ```c
        ((struct sockaddr_in*)&bindaddr)->sin_port= htons(options.bind_port);
        if (bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&bindaddr, bindaddrlen) != 0) {
            error("bind %s: %s", ntop, strerror(errno));
            goto fail;
        }
    ```
    
6. 编译

    ```
    autoreconf && ./configure && make 
    ```

7. 软链接一个`ln -s .ssh  .myssh`

8. 运行
    ```
    ./myssh  -b 192.168.1.153:5566  root@xxx.xyz
    ```
7. 然后再打开一个终端查看试用的端口
    ```
    vmuser@ubuntu:~$ lsof | grep "myssh.*TCP"
    myssh     110179                 vmuser    3u     IPv4            4018314      0t0        TCP ubuntu:5566->myother_ubuntu:ssh (ESTABLISHED)
```

This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's sample
implementation with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to
external libraries), all known security bugs fixed, new features
reintroduced and many other clean-ups.  OpenSSH has been created by
Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
and Dug Song. It has a homepage at https://www.openssh.com/

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support, EGD/PRNGD support and replacements for OpenBSD library
functions that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port
has been best tested on AIX, Cygwin, HP-UX, Linux, MacOS/X,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenServer, Solaris and UnixWare.

This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to https://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to https://bugzilla.mindrot.org or
the mailing list openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org.  To mitigate spam, the
list only allows posting from subscribed addresses.  Code contribution
are welcomed, but please follow the OpenBSD style guidelines[1].

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on dependencies and
how to install OpenSSH on your system.

Miscellania -

This version of OpenSSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository which in turn was based on the last free sample implementation
released by Tatu Ylonen.
